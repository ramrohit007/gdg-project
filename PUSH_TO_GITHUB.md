# Push to GitHub - Quick Guide

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new (should be open in your browser)
2. Repository name: `gdg1` (or any name you prefer)
3. Choose **Public** or **Private**
4. **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check any boxes (no README, .gitignore, or license)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL
After creating, GitHub will show you a URL like:
- `https://github.com/yourusername/gdg1.git`

## Step 3: Run These Commands

Once you have the URL, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\CHINTA ROHIT RAM\OneDrive\Desktop\gdg1"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/gdg1.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Or** just share the repository URL with me and I'll run these commands for you!

## Alternative: If you want me to do it automatically

Just paste the repository URL here and I'll execute the push commands.
